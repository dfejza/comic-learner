# Comic Learner

Comic learner is a web platform used to study Japanese in a productive manner. Targeted towards the lower intermediate to advance level Japanese learner, the user can read Japanese Comics in their native language. Unknown words/phrases can be cropped and saved to the user's account, later to be reviewed as a flashcard for study or exported in CSV file to be imported by third party flashcard programs.
